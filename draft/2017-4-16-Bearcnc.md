<div class="post-teaser"> Introducing Bearcnc, a protocol to sublease remote house securely.</div>
<!-- more -->

<hr/>

Suppose you are going to have a summer internship in another city, and need to sublease a house remotely; or you gonna sublease your house for the coming summer, and want to discout its price to attract more people. Subleasing a remote house is really complicated. It's hard to check the quality of house and pay the rent. Fortunately we have Airbnb, although little extra money we need to pay to them. Here I discuss about my idea of a protocol to sublease remote house, sweetly.

<br>

Well, the process of finding a potential host or guest is easy (on Craigslist, Zillow ...).

### Check House Quality
Guest:
1. If you are famaliar with the neighborhood of the house, then you may skip this step; if you only need a certain 'space' to live, then you may skip this step.
2. You can ask the host to show the house on video call.

### Sublease with Contract
