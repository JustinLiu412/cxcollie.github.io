### ISIS to 2PC: an analog

The ISIS algorithm, which can maintain total ordering multicast, is similar with 2PC in that:
1. In first phase of ISIS, the sender multicast first message (message, mssg_id), and this message is not ready to be delivered; while in 2PC, the sender asks all nodes whether to commit message.
2. In second phase, peer nodes reply with their proposed sequence number, which means 'commit' similarly if sequence number is small, and means 'commit later' when is large; in 2PC, the reply message is 'commit' or not (which includes less information).
3. In third phase, sender multicast agreed sequence number, which is similar with the 'commit agreed' message in later stage (while the time to deliver may be in the future); in 2PC, the leader node broadcast 'commit' or not.

| L1 cache reference | 0.5 |
| Branch mispredict | 5	|
| L2 cache reference | 7 |
| Mutex lock/unlock | 25 |
| Main memory reference	| 100 |
| Compress 1K bytes with Zippy | 3,000 |
| Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network	| 20,000 |
| Read 1 MB sequentially from memory | 250,000 |
| Round trip within same datacenter | 500,000 |
| Disk seek	| 10,000,000 |
| Read 1 MB sequentially from disk | 20,000,000 |
| Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA |150,000,000 |
