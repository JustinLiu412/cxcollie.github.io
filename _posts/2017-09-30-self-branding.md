### Self Analysis

It's always interesting to look inside yourself, and try to make friend with yourself. I'd say it's hard to describe some of my characteristics as 'advantage' or 'disadvantage', but I will always try to convert them to be my advantage.

I'm an introvert. I love to meet new friends, but also need time to stay by myself. The time of being alone is like charging for my energy. So I can think back on recent days, stay with my pace, and 'waste' my time in the way I like. The 'disadvantage' of being an introvert is I will feel tired soon when being with other people, especially someone I'm not quite familiar with. And it's hard for me to be high in emotion. I always try to 'pour myself cold water' in an exciting moment, just to remind myself to be cautious. While the 'advantage' is I get a chance to look back and work better. And I can ensure bad thing won't happen when others are very emotional (like in a party or in work).

I'm a sensitive person. Yes, many introvert might also be sensitive. I can feel the change in other people's emotion, from their words, face and so on. I used to blame myself when I feel someone becomes depressed, but later get over it by telling myself not to take too much responsibility for others. The 'disadvantage' is that it will also make myself tired. The 'advantage' is I can quickly know how others think about my work (yeah, that's it!) and improve it till seeing the smiles on their faces.

The other interesting thing about me is, I always try to not 'let others down'. Like answering a phone, finishing a task no matter how large or small it is, or even playing a game, I will always try to reach others' expectation. Therefore I'll be nervous when preparing for the event, fearing that any preparation is not enough, and try my best to prepare it. The 'disadvantage' is sometimes I just put too much effort on small things. The 'advantage' is others can trust me when assigning task to me.

### External Analysis

I asked some of my closest friends, and what they told me is quite similar as I see myself. They can see that I am always nice to other people, but I also need time to stay alone. They think I'm a people 'who can trust on'. They are suprised when I can feel the tiny change in their emotion, and 'be on their side' when needed.

Besides that, many friends said that I am passionate about the things I love, at least initially. Even though I might change the interest soon when I'm tired of it (LOL). Yes, I always have new interest, but often give up after several days, for which I wasted some money on it. This is definitely one of the thing I should do better next time, by knowing whether it is what I love.
